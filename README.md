Etch-a-Sketch for Odin Project

This is one of the assignments for the web development course offered by the Odin Project. It's made with HTML, some CSS and javascript. 

This is a basic etch-a-sketch where hovering your mouse over a grid cell changes the colour to black. The clear button undoes all the changes and allows you to set a custom 
size for the grid.
